- INFO
    I have currently only tested this script with Ubuntu 10.04 TLS for swift 1.2 and 1.3 installations

- INSTRUCTIONS 

    1. Obtain the code 
        - GITHUB TRUNK:
            git clone git://github.com/btorch/swift-saio.sh.git

        - GITHUB TAG:
            git clone git://github.com/btorch/swift-saio.sh.git TAG_VALUE

        - Or download a tagged version as a compressed archive from github

    2. After clonning the github repo or unconpressing the archive 
        - cd into the swift-saio.sh directory 

    3. Go over the swift-saio.cfg file and make any needed changes
        - Note that some Variables MUST be changed 

    4. Once you have edited the swift-saio.cfg file to your needs, proceed 
        - Now execute the main script from within the "swift-saio.sh" directory as the root user

        For swift version 1.2 :
        - ./swift-saio.sh -r 1.2   ( KNOWN BUG: Starting of services will show a false FAIL )

        For swift version 1.3 :
        - ./swift-saio.sh -r 1.3

        *** If -r flag is not specified it will default to 1.3 version 


    PLEASE NOTE: 
        * Currently -r flag accepts only 1.2 or 1.3 version .. soon I should have trunk support

        * The -6 flag will setup a full IPv6 swift SAIO setup. It will only work if the machine/VM uses 
          IPv6 global or ULA addresses. LocalLink addresses are not acceptable. 

        * This should be run on a clean/new virtual machine OR plain machine (not used for anything else)
