- INSTRUCTIONS 

    For now this is very dirty and straight forward (only tested on ubuntu 10.04) 
    download the repo using "git clone" or tarball
    cd into the swift-saio.sh directory 
    execute ./swift-saio.sh   (as root user) 

    PLEASE NOTE: 
        This should be run a clean/new  virtual machine (not used for anything else) 
        Use it at your own risk
