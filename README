- INFO
    I have currently only tested this script with Ubuntu 10.04 TLS

- INSTRUCTIONS 


    1. Obtain the script 
        - You could "git clone git://github.com/btorch/swift-saio.sh.git"
        - Or download it as a compressed archive

    2. After clonning the github repo or unconpressing the archive 
        - cd into the swift-saio.sh directory 

    3. Go over the swift-saio.cfg file and make any needed changes
        - Note that some Variables MUST be changed 

    4. Once you have edited the swift-saio.cfg file to your needs, proceed 
        - Now execute the main script from within the "swift-saio.sh" directory as the root user
        - ./swift-saio.sh


    PLEASE NOTE: 
        * At this time you do not need to specify any flags to the script. Eventually it will accept some 
        flags but still needs to be implemented. 

        * This should be run on a clean/new virtual machine OR plain machine (not used for anything else) 
        
        * USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK
